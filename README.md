# Big Data – Clean

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
When I look back, I see trails
of myself
Could of been you, could of been
someone else
All that I know is I'm leaving
that person behind
Ooh
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm clean, I've washed it all
away
I'm so clean, you made me this
way
Now I'm ready to be the face
that never screams
'Cause I know that you want me
clean
You gave me a taste of a life I
could lead
You gave me a face for the fools
to believe
Now I'm changing, becoming one
of you
Ooh, you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm clean, I've washed it all
away
I'm so clean, you made me this
way
Now I'm ready to be the face
that never screams
'Cause I know that you want me
clean
Woah, this life
Oh, it's a dirty life
But I can show you another way
Woah, don't you wanna be like
me?
Don't you wanna be clean?
Now I'm the darkness that hides
in the light
And it's laughable watching you
put up a fight
The door's always open, it's
only a matter of time
Ooh
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm clean
I'm so clean
Now I'm ready to be the face
that never screams
'Cause I know that you want me
clean
I've washed it all away
I'm so clean, you made me this
way
Now I'm ready to be the face
that never screams
'Cause I know that you want me
clean
'Cause I know that you want me
clean
